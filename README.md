## 🧠 Why RepoLens AI?

Most tools only show metrics like stars, commits, or languages.  
**RepoLens AI acts like a recruiter.**

> “Most tools show metrics. RepoLens acts like a recruiter — it gives a verdict, highlights weaknesses, and tells exactly what to fix first.”

> “RepoLens AI doesn’t just evaluate repositories, it teaches students how to build recruiter-ready GitHub projects before evaluation.”
